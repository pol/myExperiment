<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<h1>What is a network?</h1>

<p>
  The ability to create <b>Virtual Organisations</b> (known as "networks") is a new feature for this version of myExperiment.<br/>
  Networks provide functionality for managing and sharing contributions as a <b>group</b>, using fine-grained, <b>access control</b> policies.
</p>

<h1>What additional security does this provide?</h1>

<p>
  Networks provide five layers of access control using a very simple security model:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Private access</b> - Only the <b>owner</b> is permitted to access contributions</li>
    <li><b>Protected access</b> - Only <b>network members</b> are permitted to access contributions</li>
    <li><b>Whitelisting</b> - Named users and networks are <b>allowed</b> to access contributions</li>
    <li><b>Blacklisting</b> - Named users and networks are <b>denied</b> access to contributions</li>
    <li><b>Public access</b> - <b>All users</b> (including network members) are permitted to access contributions.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
