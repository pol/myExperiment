<h2>What is a Network?</h2>

<p>
  A network is a group of people who are collaborating. You could set up a network for the members of a project, for example, 
  or for a group of colleagues with a common interest. A network has a title, an administrator and a number of members. 
  Networks provide functionality for managing and sharing contributions as a group, and sophisticated sharing permissions policies can be set up.
